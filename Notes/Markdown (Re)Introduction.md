# Headings

We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols.
To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbols.
## This is a level 2 subheading
### This is a level 3 subheading
###### This is a level 6 subheading
# Modifying Text Style

We used asterisks to modify text styling, specifically bold and italics.
e.g.
- I want this **word** specifically to be bold.
- I want this *word* to be italicised.
- I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicised.

ASIDE: If we want to place a character that is a *keyword* or reserved word and we want the **LITERAL** character, use the backslash (\\)
e.g. If we want to put an asterisk, we do this: \\\*
# ~~Strikethrough~~

We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde (\~)
- I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word~~.
- ~~This sentence is **struckthrough**~~.
# Links

We can link things in our Markdown files.
[One tool to use](https://chat.openai.com)

Exercise: If you have an openai account, do the following:
- Ask ChatGPT to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice.
- If you do not have ChatGPT/OpenAI, create two links to websites of your choice in the space below.

e.g. [My favourite website right now](https://puginarug.com/)

1. [My favorite YouTube video](https://youtube.com/shorts/MXiNjP-EVuQ?si=4ImAld8Z_unomveI) (*from ChatGPT*)
2. [My favorite game](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) (*from ChatGPT*)

# Blockquotes

Blockquotes allow us to emphasise a bigger chunk of text.
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes.

>This is an example of a blockquote.
>This is line two of the blockquote.
>
>This is the fourth line; the third is blank.

# Lists

We can create both ordered and unordered lists.
## Unordered Lists

To create each point, we use hyphens (-) with a space behind it.
We can create sublists by placing **TABS** before the hyphen.

e.g.

- dairy
	- eggs
	- milk
	- cheese
- juice
## Ordered Lists

If there is a specific order to the elements in our list, we create ordered lists.
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists.

e.g.

1. Put butter into mixing bowl.
2. Add sugar to butter.
   Add both brown and regular sugar.
4. Use the mixer to cream the butter.
# Tables

We can organise information in tables using Markdown.
We use hyphens (-) and pipes (|)

Tables in Markdown require headings.

e.g.

|Name|Age|Sign|Superpower|
|-|-|-|-|
|Bruce Wayne|35|Aquarius|Intelligence/$|
|Mr. Ubial|Unaging|All of them|Dad Strength|
|Sunny|17|Dingo|Dingo|
