# Syntax Errors

These types of errors are ones where you run your code and something breaks.
Syntax errors are relatively easy to fix.
Syntax errors happen when we do not follow the rules completely.

Some examples are when we forget a closing " or ).

# Semantic Errors

Semantic errors are much more challenging (in Ubial's opinion).
Semantic errors are where you code does not "mean" what you actually mean.

```python
user_response=input('Do you like to eat food? ')

if user_response=='yes':
	print('You passed the human test.')
else:
	print('You must be some sort of robot.')
```

The problem with the above code is subtle. What I (Mr. Ubial) mean is that if the user answer with ANYTHING affirmative, the code should go into the `'yes'` block.

One way to solve this problem is to use [[Strings#String Methods|string methods]].

We can use `.lower()` to catch all permutations of capital letters.

```python
user_response=input('Do you like to eat food? ').lower()

#yes yeS yEs Yes yES YeS YEs YES
if user_response=='yes':
	print('You passed the human test.')
else:
	print('You must be some sort of robot.')
```
